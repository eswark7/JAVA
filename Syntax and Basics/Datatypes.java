/*
Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes

Primitive Data Types:
A primitive data type specifies the type of a variable and the kind of values it can hold.
8 Types
byte	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short	Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
int	    Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long	Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 to 16 decimal digits
boolean	Stores true or false values
char	Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values

Non-Primitive Data Types:
Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects
Created by programmers (except String)
Uppercase (e.g., String)
