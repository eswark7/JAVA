/*
Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. And the class name should always start with an uppercase first letter.
The name of the java file must match the class name.
Any code inside the main() method will be executed.

/*
print()/println()
The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output
