✅ Control Statements in Java
Normally, Java code runs top to bottom, but control statements let you change the flow — like 
making decisions, repeating tasks, or jumping out of loops.

1️⃣ Decision Making Statements (Choose between options)

if
if-else
switch

2️⃣ Loop Statements (Repeat tasks)

for-each loop

3️⃣ Jump Statements (Change loop execution)

continue
