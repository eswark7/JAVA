🧰 JDK – Java Development Kit

You use it to write and compile Java code.

You write your code in a .java file.

JDK provides a compiler (javac) to convert .java → .class (bytecode).

Without JDK, you cannot create Java programs.


🚀 JRE – Java Runtime Environment

It helps you run Java programs.

JRE contains everything needed to run a .class file.

It includes the JVM + libraries (like for input/output, math, etc.).

You don’t write code with JRE — you just run the program.


⚙️ JVM – Java Virtual Machine

It executes the actual bytecode.

JVM reads the .class file.

Converts bytecode into machine code your computer understands.

Handles memory, garbage collection, and more.
